# E-learningWithHiberate

Automation for understanding basics of JPA Hibernate Where I used @NamedQueries, @Transaction, @Embeddable-@Embedded-@EmbeddedId, Junit5, Relationships(oneToMany-ManyToOne-OneToOne), Inheritance mappings(Single Table - Joined - Table Per Class -MappedSuperClass) 
  ADDITIONALLY I implemented various concepts such as  :
            *Profiles 
            *Dependency Injection
            *@Qualifier - @Primary 
            *Mapstruct @Mapper
            *AOP 
            *DTO pattern 
            *RestAPI
            *Records 
            *Optionals
